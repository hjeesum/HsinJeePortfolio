        Hi! I'm a software engineer with a focus on AI and machine learning,
        currently completing an integrated master's in Computer Science with
        Artificial Intelligence at the University of Leeds (graduating June
        2026).

        I love myself a good challenge, and am always looking for opportunities
        to learn and grow. I'm passionate about using technology to solve
        real-world problems, and am always looking for ways to make a positive
        impact on the world. I'm also a big fan of open source software, and am
        always looking for ways to contribute to the community.
      </p>

        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
        since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
        scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
        centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
        essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release
        of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
        with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
        of Lorem Ipsum
